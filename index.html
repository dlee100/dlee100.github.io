      <h2 id="welcome-to-github-pages">Welcome to my portfolio</h2>

<p>On this page I will showcase my personal works in technology.</p>

<p>I graduated from George Mason University with a Bachelors Degree in Information Technology (concentration in Web Application Development) in December 2020. I am currently studying for the CompTIA Linux+ certification and I am also actively applying for junior positions in systems and software development/operations.</p>

<p>For a junior-level candidate and recent college graduate, I am well experienced in Linux systems and the Python programming language. I also have experience in DevOps tools and methodogies such as Jenkins, Docker, Ansible and CI/CD pipeline maintenance and configuration.</p>

<h3>Linux</h3>
<p>I have an avid interest for the Linux operating system on servers and desktops. I like how it is free and open source and there are tons of community support for the extensible system. I have been thoroughly exposed to Linux and the Bash terminal through my DevOps Engineer internship in Summer 2020. Bash scripting and using extensible software like the Vim editor has opened my eyes to how powerful scripting can be in an operating system. I have set up development servers through virtual machines and on some of my own machines with CentOS. In my senior capstone in college, I have set up testing and development environments using Ubuntu environments in the cloud and Docker containers. In my personal time, I like to research and use several Linux distributions. I have used Linux Mint, Ubuntu, Manjaro, Kali, Pop!_OS, and now I am onto Debian.</p>

<h3>Python</h3>
<p>Python is said to be a great beginner's programming language because of its easy to read syntax. For an experienced programmer, the syntax looks like pseudocode. I took three Python courses in college.</p>
