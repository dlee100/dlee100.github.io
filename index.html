      <h2 id="welcome-to-github-pages">Welcome to my github.io site.</h2>

<p>This page is just an about me within software.</p>

<p>I graduated from George Mason University with a Bachelors Degree in Information Technology (concentration in Web Development and Multimedia) in December 2020. I am currently working as a Software Integration Engineer, heavily concentrated in custom Red Hat Enterprise Linux Operating Systems within my workplace. When I have some time I study for the RHCSA certification and I also study and practice the Rust programming language.</p>

<h3>Rust</h3>
<p>I am currently obsessed with the Rust programming language. I have some personal projects I am working on to hone this skill. More to come in my GitHub.</p>

<h3>Linux</h3>
<p>I have an avid interest for the Linux operating system on servers and desktops. I like how it is free and open source and there are tons of community support for the extensible system. I have been thoroughly exposed to Linux and the Bash terminal through my DevOps Engineer internship in Summer 2020. Bash scripting and using extensible software like the Vim editor has opened my eyes to how powerful scripting can be in an operating system. I have set up development servers through virtual machines and on some of my own machines with CentOS. In my senior capstone in college, I have set up testing and development environments using Ubuntu environments in the cloud and Docker containers.</p>

<h3>Python</h3>
<p>Throughout my four years in George Mason University, I took three Python courses: Beginners, Object Oriented Programming, and Data Structures and Algorithms. I would say that Python was my first programming language that I have learned and used. The syntax is easy is remember and easy to read.</p>
